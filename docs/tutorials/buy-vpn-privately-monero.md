# Where to buy a VPN privately with Monero (XMR)

People spend ***billions*** of dollars on virtual private servers (VPNs) each year, which is a staggering amount of money.

Unfortunately, many people make the huge mistake of paying for their VPN using a traceable payment method, such as a credit card or debit card.

The simplest way to purchase a VPN privately is to use [Monero (XMR)](https://monero.com), the gold standard in private digital payments. Luckily, there are several excellent VPN options that directly accept Monero as a payment method.

Ulike Bitcoin payments, Monero payments hide the sender, receiver, and amount. If you use a [non-custodial wallet](https://monero.com/wallets) to pay for your VPN with Monero, it offers similar privacy benefits as paying with cash.

## Why should I buy a VPN with Monero (XMR)?

VPNs are digital products, and it's simplest to buy digital products using a digital payment method.

Compared to other digital payment methods, Monero is substantially easier to use and substantially more private.

It's possible to purchase some VPN services by mailing them cash, or by buying a gift card at a store with cash. These are also good, private options, but they aren't as simple as paying with a digital currency.
